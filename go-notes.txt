step 1: we can not run go project outside of the go path which is the place where go is installed so to do that in the root directory

you will see go.mod file now you can use go outside of workspace

create main.go in the root folder and once you write a code perform go build && exe file name.exe

go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
